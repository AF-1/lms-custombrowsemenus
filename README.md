Custom Browse Menus

![Min. LMS Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Min.-LMS-Version-Required-7.9-darkgreen)<br>

A modified version of the CustomBrowse plugin by Erland Isaksson.<br>
**No guarantees that it will work or continue to do so**.<br>
I uploaded it so that others who want to continue with this plugin don't have to waste time with the changes I've already made - if they want to keep them.
