Custom Browse Menus
====

A modified version of the CustomBrowse plugin by Erland Isaksson.<br>
**No guarantees that it will work or continue to do so**.<br>
I uploaded it so that others who want to continue with this plugin don't have to waste time with the changes I've already made - if they want to keep them.

⚠️ **I'm not maintaining this plugin. I don't provide support for it.**
<br><br>

## Requirements

- LMS version >= 7.**9**
- LMS database = SQLite

<br><br>

## Changes

- works with [**Custom Tag Importer**](https://github.com/AF-1/) plugin (instead of *CustomScan* plugin)
- should support **virtual libraries** (instead of *MultiLibrary* plugin)
- UI changes
- ...

<br><br>
